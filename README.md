# meiosis-routing

# Deprecated

[Meiosis](https://meiosis.js.org) is a pattern, not a library. Nevertheless, in response to popular
demand and for your convenience, here are some reusable snippets of code that help setup and use
Meiosis. This module provides support for routing in two modules:

- `state`: provides functions that help manage routing state
- `router-helper`: provides support for configuring routes and creating a router. Out-of-the-box
  support is provided for these router libraries:

    - [feather-route-matcher](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/feather-route-matcher)
    - [url-mapper](https://github.com/cerebral/url-mapper)
    - [Mithril Router](https://mithril.js.org/route.html)

You can also plug in another router library of your choice.

## Benefits!

Meiosis Routing gives you _programmable routes_ which you manage in application state, with the
following benefits:

- Simple route configuration
- No hardcoded paths in links
- Parent and child routes, and reusable child routes
- Relative navigation: navigate to a parent, sibling, or child route
- Navigate to the same route but with different parameters
- Redirect to a route after an action
- Authenticate / authorize before going to a route
- Load data (synchronously or asynchronously) when arriving at a route
- Clean up state when leaving a route
- Trigger arriving and leaving a route based on route and query parameters
- Prevent leaving a route to e.g. warn user of unsaved data

Because routing is managed in application state, you don't need a complex router with support for
all of the above. The actual router is just a thin layer that matches URLs to routes. You can use
one of the routers mentioned above, or plug in your own.
[feather-route-matcher](https://github.com/henrikjoreteg/feather-route-matcher) is a nice example of
how you only need a lightweight router library.

## Installation

Using `npm`:

```
npm i meiosis-routing
```

Using a `script` tag:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/meiosis-routing"></script>
```

Using the `script` tag exposes a `MeiosisRouting` global, under which the helper functions are
provided:

- `state.*`
- `routerHelper.*`

## Using `meiosis-routing`

> **PLEASE NOTE** that this is a summary of how to use `meiosis-routing`. Refer to
[this tutorial](https://meiosis.js.org/docs/routing.html) for a more detailed explanation.
Also refer to the tutorial to use `meiosis-routing` with [Mithril](https://mithil.js.org).

### Create Route Segments

Meiosis Routing is based on the idea of _route segments_, which are plain objects of the form
`{ id, params }`. Then, a _route_ is an **array** of route segments:

```javascript
[{ id: "User", params: { name: "duck" }, { id: "Profile" } }]
```

Using an array of route segments opens up some nice possibilities:

- Navigating to same, parent, sibling, or child route
- Creating reusable child routes
- Managing pages and transitions independently of route paths

For convenience, `meiosis-routing/state` provides the `createRouteSegments` to which you provide an
array of strings that correspond to the route segments of your application:

```javascript
import { createRouteSegments } from "meiosis-routing/state";

const Route = createRouteSegments([
  "Home",
  "Login",
  "User",
  "Profile",
  "Preferences"
]);

Route.Home()
// returns { id: "Home", params: {} }

[Route.User({ name: "duck" }), Route.Profile()]
// returns [{ id: "User", params: { name: "duck" } }, { id: "Profile", params: {} }]
```

Now that we can create route segments and routes (arrays of route segments), let's use _routing_ to
manage them.

### Use `Routing`

We'll store the current route in the application state, under `route`:

```javascript
{ route: [Route.Home()] }
```

Next, from our top-level component, we'll create an instance of `Routing`, passing in the current
route. The `routing` instance we get has these properties and functions:

- `localSegment: RouteSegment`
- `childSegment: RouteSegment`
- `next(): routing`
- `parentRoute(): Route`
- `childRoute(route): Route`
- `siblingRoute(route): Route`
- `sameRoute(params): Route`

We can now render the top-level component according to the `localSegment` id. We can use a simple
`string`&rarr;`Component` map to look up the corresponding component:

```javascript
import { Routing } from "meiosis-routing/state";
import { Home, Login, User } from "./our-components";

const componentMap = { Home, Login, User };

const Root = ({ state }) => {
  const routing = Routing(state.route);
  const Component = componentMap[routing.localSegment.id];

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      <Component /* other props... */ routing={routing} />
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Then in the `Component`, we can use `routing.localSegment.params` to retrieve any params. Again we
can use a component map, now using `routing.childSegment.id`. We can do this for as many levels as
we want, taking care to pass `routing.next()` down to the child component so that we "advance" the
routing instance:

```javascript
import { Profile, Preferences } from "./our-components";

const componentMap = { Profile, Preferences };

const User = ({ state, routing }) => {
  const params = routing.localSegment.params;
  const Component = componentMap[routing.childSegment.id];

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      <Component /* other props... */ routing={routing.next()} />
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

To navigate to a route, we can use a simple action that updates the state's `route` property:

```javascript
const navigateTo = route => ({ nextRoute: () => Array.isArray(route) ? route : [route] });

const Actions = update => ({ navigateTo: route => update(navigateTo(route)) });

const update = ...;
const actions = Actions(update);

// ...

<a href="#" onClick={() => actions.navigateTo(
  [Route.User({ id: userId }), Route.Profile()]
)}>
  User Profile
</a>
```

We can also navigate to a parent route, child route, sibling route, and same route:

```jsx
// Say we are in [Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile()].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name })]
<a href="#" onClick={() => actions.navigateTo(
  routing.parentRoute()
)}>
  User
</a>

// Say we are in [Route.User({ name })].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile()]
<a href="#" onClick={() => actions.navigateTo(
  routing.childRoute(Route.Profile())
)}>
  Profile
</a>

// Say we are in [Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile()].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name }), Route.Preferences({ name })]
<a href="#" onClick={() => actions.navigateTo(
  routing.siblingRoute(Route.Preferences({ name }))
)}>
  Preferences
</a>

// Say we are in [Route.User({ name: "name1" })].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name: "name2" })]
<a href="#" onClick={() => actions.navigateTo(
  routing.sameRoute({ name: "name2" }))
)}>
  Preferences
</a>
```

Note that you can also pass an array of route segments to `childRoute` and `siblingRoute`.

We now have an application that uses routing and works just fine without a router and without paths.
To add paths, we can plug in a simple router library.

### Create and use a Router

Adding a router gives us the ability to generate paths and put them in the `href` attribute of our
links. The path will show in the browser's location bar, users can use the _back_ and _forward_
buttons, bookmark links, and so on.

What's nice is that we can continue using _programmatic_ routes as we've done so far. Route paths
are generated from routes, so we never have to hardcode paths or mess with them in our application's
routing logic.

#### Route Configuration

First, we create a route configuration. This is a plain object with `id`&rarr;`config` mappings,
where `id` is the id of the route segment, and `config` can either be:

- a string: the route path
- an array: `[ path, (optional) array of parameters from the parent, nested route config ]`

For example:

```javascript
const routeConfig = {
  Home: "/",
  User: ["/user/:name", {
    Profile: "/profile",
    Preferences: ["/preferences", ["name"]]
  }]
}
```

This gives us the following path &rarr; route mappings:

- `/` &rarr; `[Route.Home()]`
- `/user/:name` &rarr; `[Route.User({ name })]`
- `/user/:name/profile` &rarr; `[Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile()]`
- `/user/:name/preferences` &rarr; `[Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile({ name })]`

#### Create the Router

Next, we create a router. The router libraries mentioned at the top of the page are supported
out-of-the-box. Let's use `feather-route-matcher`:

```javascript
import createRouteMatcher from "feather-route-matcher";
import { createFeatherRouter } from "meiosis-routing/router-helper";

const routeConfig = { ... };

const router = createFeatherRouter({
  createRouteMatcher,
  routeConfig,
  defaultRoute: [Route.Home()]
});
```

#### Use the Router

This gives us a `router` with:

- `router.initialRoute`: the initial route as parsed from the browser's location bar. We can use
  this in our application's initial state, `{ route: router.initialRoute }`
- `router.start()`: a function to call at application startup. We pass a `navigateTo` callback for
  route changes: `router.start({ navigateTo: actions.navigateTo })`
- `router.toPath(route)`: converts a route into a path. For example, `router.toPath([Route.Home()])`
  or a relative route such as `router.toPath(routing.parentRoute())`.
- `router.locationBarSync()`: a function to call to keep the location bar in sync. Every time the
  state changes, we call `router.locationBarSync(state.route)`.

Now that we have `router.toPath`, we no longer need to have `href="#"` and `onClick={...}` in our
links. Instead, we can use `router.toPath()` in `href`:

```jsx
// Say we are in [Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile()].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name })]
<a href={router.toPath(routing.parentRoute())}>
  User
</a>

// Say we are in [Route.User({ name })].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile()]
<a href={router.toPath(routing.childRoute(Route.Profile()))}>
  Profile
</a>

// Say we are in [Route.User({ name }), Route.Profile()].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name }), Route.Preferences({ name })]
// Notice that we don't have to specify ({ name }) in Route.Preferences(),
// since it is a parameter that is inherited from the parent route segment.
<a href={router.toPath(routing.siblingRoute(Route.Preferences()))}>
  Preferences
</a>

// Say we are in [Route.User({ name: "name1" })].
// This navigates to [Route.User({ name: "name2" })]
<a href={router.toPath(routing.sameRoute({ name: "name2" }))}>
  Profile
</a>
```

#### (Optional) Use Query Strings

We can use query strings by plugging in a query string library such as:

- [query-string](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string)
- [qs](https://github.com/ljharb/qs)
- [urlon](https://github.com/cerebral/urlon)

> Note that query strings work out-of-the-box with [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org).
Refer to the [routing tutorial](https://meiosis.js.org/docs/routing.html) for information on using
`meiosis-routing` with Mithril.

To use a query string library, we just need to specify it as `queryString` when creating the router:

```javascript
import createRouteMatcher from "feather-route-matcher";
import qs from "qs";

const router = createFeatherRouter({
  createRouteMatcher,
  queryString: qs,
  routeConfig,
  defaultRoute: [Route.Home()]
});
```

Then, we specify query string parameters in our route configuration using `?` and/or `&`:

```javascript
const routeConfig = {
  Home: "/",
  User: ["/user/:name?param1", {
    Profile: "/profile?param2&param3",
    Preferences: ["/preferences", ["name"]]
  }]
};
```

The parameters will be available in our route segments just like path parameters.

### Use Transitions

It's often desirable to load data when arriving at a route, clear data when leaving a route, guard a
route to restrict access, and so on. We can do them with route _transitions_.

`meiosis-routing` provides a `routeTransition` function that takes the current and next route state
and returns a route transition object, `{ leave: {...}, arrive: {...} }`. You can use this function
in a [service function](http://meiosis.js.org/docs/services.html#using_meiosis_setup) to update the
state with the route transition.

As a service function, it looks like this:

```javascript
const service = state => ({
  routeTransition: () => routeTransition(state.route, state.nextRoute),
  route: state.nextRoute
});
```

With this, `state.routeTransition` will contain `leave` and `arrive` properties with the routes that
we left and arrived to, keyed by route id. We can then use this to perform any actions we want when
leaving from or arriving to a route:

```javascript
// in service function, reducer, etc.

function loadDataForUser(state) {
  if (state.routeTransition.arrive.User) {
    const name = state.routeTransition.arrive.User.params.name;
    // load data for user according to the value of 'name'...
  }
}

function cleanup(state) {
  if (state.routeTransition.leave.User) {
    // leaving User route segment, cleanup...
  }
}
```

### For More Details

As mentioned above, you will find a more in-depth tutorial in the
[Meiosis Routing documentation](https://meiosis.js.org/docs/routing.html).

More details are also available in the
[API documentation](https://meiosis.js.org/meiosis-routing/modules/_index_.html).

## Changelog

- Version 3.0.0: Works with `feather-route-matcher` version `4.x`. Breaking changes: removed
  `navigateTo` and `Actions` since they were limited to working with Mergerino. These should instead
  be implemented in application code.

- Version 2.1.0: Works with `feather-route-matcher` version `3.x`.
